# Statistics-Automations

## Introduction
Automate some statistics metods in Python. A lot of statistics calculations(Correlation Coefficient, Chi-square tests, Binomial Variables, Poisson Distributions etc.) can be automated and used in large scale projects. 

## Tasks
1. Find the Correlation Coefficient between every pair of columns from a fully numeric table. 

## Technologies used
MySQL Workbench

Python(mysql.connector, math and re libraries)

## Setup 
1. Pick or create a numeric-only table in MySQL.
2. Use your hostname, username and password to connect python with MySQL using mysql.connector.
3. Change tha table near the end of the script with your own table(correlation_c = correlation_coeficient('world_2.country_x'))

##Examples of use
The result should look like this:
